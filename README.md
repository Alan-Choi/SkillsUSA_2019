**Calculate** will display a receipt which must include the user's pizza choices with prices listed next to the selected item along with
the final total. Make sure you format it to look like a receipt.

If the user only orders one pizza, then show one receipt.
If the user ordered two pizzas, then show both receipts on the same screen separately with one listed below the other.

**Start Over** will allow the user to start over on the order. All the way back to entering their name again.

**Exit** will close the program and give the user a nice message that says, "Thank you for using the Pizza Ordering program"
